# Ciphers
Finals Term project for ITC C202 - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Included Ciphers:
- Caesar Cipher - `CaesarChiper.java`
- Playfair Cipher - `PlayfairCipher.java`
- Polybius Square Cipher - `PolybiusSquareCipher.java`
- Positionally Shifted Cipher (our own custom encryption algorithm) - `PositionallyShiftedCipher.java`

## Running
If you have IntelliJ IDEA, then simply download this whole repo as a zip file, unzip it to a folder, then import that folder as a project

If you prefer using the terminal to compile, do the following:
1. Download the repo as a zip file, then unzip it to a folder
2. Open cmd or Terminal, then navigate to the folder you created and then to the src/ folder where the .java files are located
3. Run the following command `javac Ciphers.java`. This will compile not just the main class, but also all the other cipher classes automatically.
4. Run the program by using the command `java Ciphers`.

## Note
Everything is messy because I do not know what I am doing 75% of the time.
